# Loan System Redo

During my time at university, I was tasked to create a loan system for the technicians I worked with to help track loaned out equipment to staff and students. This repo is a redo of that using techniques and frameworks I've learnt over the years to make it better in literally everyway. 

Looking back at the original code was a horrible experience..

This new repo utilises more Laravel packages (like horizon and jetstream) to make it easier for jobs to be ran and authentication as well as frontend frameworks (like vue and tailwind) rather than using the blade files built into Laravel and Bootstrap CSS. As well as this, it will also include unit tests using Pest to test the different functionality of the site.
